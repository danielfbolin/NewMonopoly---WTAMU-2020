# NewMonopoly-WTAMU-2020
NewMonopoly multiplayer game based on Monopoly

NewMonopoly is a collaborative Senior Design project completed during the Fall 2019 and Spring 2020 semesters at West Texas A&M University.
This project is a response to the challenge posed by SCORE 2018 (http://score-contest.org/2018/projects/newmonopoly.php).
Our implementation uses Unity and the Photon Unity Networking asset for multiplayer support.

NewMonopoly is currently playable online with support for up to 4 players in a game. It is hosted on Firebase and accessible from any modern web browser with HTML5 support.
Some gameplay functionality is fairly limited after our final implementation update and unknown bugs may exist. Play online here: https://newmonopoly-wtamu.web.app/
